# Crowdfunding_ETL

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organisations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success.

In this project, I used the data in excel format, loaded it in Jupyter notebook and cleaned the files using Python. Afterthat, I constructed a Crowndfunding Database in pgAdmin using Postgres SQL.

The below main steps have been followed:

1. Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
2. Create the Campaign DataFrame
3. Create the Contacts DataFrame
4. Sketch an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBD
5. Create the Crowdfunding Database using Postgres SQL
